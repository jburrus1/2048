# 2048
 
My version of the game 2048, coded from scratch in Unity game engine. I based the game off of my experience playing the original, so it might not be a perfect recreation. The goal of the game is to move the tiles using the arrow keys and try to slide matching tiles into each other to create higher-numbered tiles.

A WebGL build can be played [here](https://jburrus1.github.io/2048).
